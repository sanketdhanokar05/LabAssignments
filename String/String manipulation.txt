String Test
---------------

Create a class with methods
  1. concatAdd() with return type String and parameters two Strings access public
   remove spaces from the strings and concatinate them and return it
  2. reverse() with return String and parameter one String access public
   reverse the characters in the string and return it
  3. paddingIndex() with return int and params two Strings access protected

String 
----------

Create class Game {
  String palyer1;
  String palyer2;
 ...

Create class PalyMonitor {
   Game game;
  String winningTracking;
  (value stored will be no of games in a month, no of wins in a month : .....}
  for e.g if player won 2/3 and 2/5 and 0/2 then store as "3,2:5,2:2,0"

methods:
  int matchWin(String winningTracking){
     get the number of games and wins and calculate percentage and return the value

  int playerValidate(winningTracking, game) {
     check if name is start with Caps, followed by small letters, can have hiphen, space

String handling

Problem statement #4
Develop an application to build the Person object from the given input string.

Operations:-
1.	Build the Person object from the given string. 
2.	Find the grade of the person based on the salary
a)	If salary<10000, he is C grade
b)	If salary>=10000 and salary<=25000, he is B grade
c)	If salary>25000, he is A grade

Specifications:-

1.	create a Person class
   properties:
private string loc;
private string name;
private double salary;
add constructors, setters, getters, toString methods
2.	Create a Main class and in the main method accept a String as input in the following format
Location Name         Salary
HydNMKiran-KumarSAL25
Where, first word is Location and Name is preceded by NM
And salary is preceded by SAL.

3.	Implement method to accept Location,Name,Salary as a single String.
And extract the Location, Name, salary according the pattern.
And build the Person object and return the same.
Method:-
	Public  Person    buildPerson(String locationNameSalaryString){

	// write the logic to extract all properly and build Person object
	//refer next step to create Person object.
	}

4.	Implement the method to find out the grade of a given Person object.
Method:-
	Public  String  findGrade(Person person){
	//write the logic by referring operations section
	//return grade as String
	}
